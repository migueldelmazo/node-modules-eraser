# Node modules folder eraser

## Purpose

This Node script searches your computer for the `node_modules/` directories to delete them. Before deleting a `node_modules/` directory the program will ask you if you want to do so.

## How is it used?

Run `index.js` with the path where you want to search, for example:

```bash
node index.js ./
```

```bash
node index.js ./projects/
```

```bash
node index.js ../../../
```
